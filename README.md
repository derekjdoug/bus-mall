### Reflections and Comments

- Over-complicated this one insanely today. The (a) answer--although probably not easily scalable in its current iteration--was only about 12 lines of added code.
- I think I relied too much on the examples and not what made logical sense with the functionality of the tools. It can be difficult when I feel like I'm in a time crunch, but sometimes I believe I need to step back and ask myself "at its most basic, what does this tool do, and how can I use it?".
- This class has been really good for improving my thought processes. I have a very abstract way of thinking, so patterns and connections are easy for me to make--I often get lost when needed to begin with the small details. Instead of missing the forest for the trees, I miss the trees for the forest. Understanding this and facing it has been good, I think.
