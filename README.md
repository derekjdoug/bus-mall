### Reflections and Comments

- I know my JavaScript code is likely *significantly* longer than it needs to be. While I understood the logic enough to work through and make all of my functionality work, I need to now take the next step and work to make it more efficient.
- I also need more work on using event listeners and event handlers. Again, I implemented them enough for functionality, but I know I can use and write them more effectively in the future from lessons learned in this lab.
