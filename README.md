### Reflections and Comments

- Overall BusMall was a great experience that I ultimately want to revisit and parse through again. Working with local storage proved to be a challenge that I'm beginning to understand, but don't have fully formed in my mind yet.
- This project has spurred me to look deeper in Constructor functions (and their prototypes...appropriate time to use, etc.) and event listeners. I feel like I'm slowly progressing on both of them but I want to really get them down.
- Don't forget things you have already learned for the sake of implementing new ideas!
